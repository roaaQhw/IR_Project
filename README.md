# IR Project

## Overview
This project focuses on text processing using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objective is to clean and prepare text data for further analysis or machine learning tasks. The project leverages several NLP libraries and methods to process the text, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removal of stop words and punctuation.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `nltk`
- `contractions`
- `inflect`
- `re`
- `string`
- `pickle`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas nltk contractions inflect

# Information Retrieval and Text Processing Project

To run the code in this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `json`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `sys`
- `nltk`
- `contractions`
- `re`
- `inflect`
- `string`
- `pickle`

Install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk contractions inflect

- `Flask`
- `requests`

Install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install Flask requests


# Antique Query Suggestion Service

## Overview
This project implements a Flask application that suggests antique-related queries based on a given input query. It reads a list of predefined queries from a JSON file and suggests queries that contain the input query as a substring.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `Flask`

Install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install Flask


# Lifestyle Search Service

## Overview
This project implements a Flask application that performs search queries on a collection of lifestyle-related texts. It utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find and return the most relevant documents based on the input query.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `Flask`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`

Install these dependencies using pip:
